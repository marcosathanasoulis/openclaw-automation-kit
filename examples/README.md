# Examples (Onboarding)

This folder is for onboarding/tutorial automations.

Current example:
- `public_page_check` (zero-credential smoke test)
- `stock_price_check` (market price check via Yahoo Finance)
- `weather_check` (current weather via Open-Meteo, no API key)

Use `library/` for PR-approved scripts intended for production-like usage.
