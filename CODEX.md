# CODEX.md

Codex agents must follow `/Users/Marcos/code-projects/openclaw-automation-kit/AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for:

- allowlisted repository scope
- coordination (`INPROCESS.md`/`HANDOFF.md`) workflow
- branching/commit policy
- remote write and PR/merge safety
- security and data handling guardrails
